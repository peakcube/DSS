# DSS Paper: "Peak Cubes in Service Operations: Bringing Multidimensionality into Decision Support Systems"
In this repository you can find examples for implementing the main algorithms and ideas in the DSS paper titled “Peak Cubes in Service Operations: Bringing Multidimensionality into Decision Support Systems” in Decision Support Systems.

The comments in the codes should help you follow the logic; having the paper open on the side also helps!

If you have any problem or question deploying this, or if you need help implementing these ideas for your project, please feel free to reach out to the authors of the DSS paper (their emails can be found in the paper)—they will be happy to help you apply these ideas to your data to solve impactful problems 😊
