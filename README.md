# DSS Paper: Peak Cubes in Service Operations: Bringing Multidimensionality into Decision Support Systems
In this repository you can find examples for implementing the main algorithms and ideas in the DSS paper titled “Peak Cubes in Service Operations: Bringing Multidimensionality into Decision Support Systems” in Decision Support Systems.
The comments in the codes should help you follow the logic; please also have the paper open on the side 😊
Still, if you have any problem or question, or if you need help implementing this for your project, please feel free to reach out to the authors of the DSS paper (their emails are in the paper)—they will be happy to help you apply these ideas to your data to solve impactful problems 😊
